Windows Authentication can also be combined with MFA.

The digits result from a SHA1 algorithm, making it unlikely that this code can be deducted within these 30 seconds. Additionally, the employee will be inactivated if the maximum MFA login attempts are exceeded, just like with the password login.</p> <p>Note: If the user account of the employee in Shopper is reactivated (for example after deactivation caused by exceeding the maximum MFA login attempts) the password is also reset, forcing the user to specify a new password. Additionally, it is required to use the authentication App and recreate the account. Depending on the authentication App used, it can be required to first remove the existing account.</p> <p>Once the account is created in the authentication app and it is activated in Shopper, the consecutive MFA logins will request the 6-digit authentication code to be entered, based on the code obtained using the authentication App. Press the button \"Verify\" to validate the authentication code and upon success get redirected to the Shopper home screen.</p> <p>If you do not have the authentication App available at that time, use the link \"Cancel\" to abort the MFA login attempt.</p> <p>Note: The code changes every 30 seconds. The authentication App will indicate if this is about to happen. Keep this in mind when entering the code in Shopper. If the code is changed before you can press the \"Verification\" button in Shopper, the code will be rejected, and you will have to enter the new code shown in the authentication App.</p> <p>Just as before, each rejected authentication code will count as a failed login attempt (regarding the maximum number of login attempts). Cancelling the MFA verification does not count as a login failure.</p> <p>Note: If you are no longer in possession of the mobile phone with the authentication App of if you reinstalled the authentication App and the Shopper account is no longer available in the App, you will have to request the Shopper administrator to reset your account/password, allowing you to restart the account registration process, using the authentication App.</p>"},{"location":"#user-settings","title":"User settings","text":"<p>In the User Settings you can choose your user settings.

These indicators apply to the entire system (i.e., to all administrations).</p> Column 1 Column 2 Budgets #### Budget control? Set this indicator If budget control is used for any of the financial administrations. Per administrative year of the financial administration, you can indicate if budget control applies. As such it becomes possible to manage annual budgets with actions to be included in the ToDo (continued) process flow under \"Action by authorized signatory\" and \"Accept orders\" for approving budget overruns. #### Determine budget indicator? If budget indicators have to be determined, the impact on the budget is shown with colored flags in the \"Action by authorized signatory\" and \"Accept orders\" with colored flags - at the order and the order lines. Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Derive budget expenditure If Shopper has to derive the budget expenditure, this is passed on in real-time in Shopper, based on the allocation that follows from the P2P process and the proforma orders for contracts. If not, this must be determined in batch processing, for example when integrating with external systems or via the import budget. #### Show previous periods with budget info #### The budget info dialog also shows the data of the previous budget period, which can be requested via the flag in the requisition/order line at the process step authorized sign or order approval. Column 1 Column 2 --- --- Order #### Order in a foreign currency? If it is allowed to order in foreign currency, then items with prices in foreign currency can also be requested. See also &gt;&gt; [Countries and currencies]{.underline} #### Deviating delivery address allowed? If different delivery addresses are allowed, a different delivery address and related email notification can be specified at the bottom of the requisition. Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Send order line as a separate order If an order line can be included exclusively in an order, then the checkbox \"Exclusively in order\" will be available with the requisition for the item, in order to send different items from the same supplier as separate orders. #### Send requisition as separate order If a requisition can be sent as a separate order the checkbox \"Send whole as a separate order\" becomes available as part of the \"Apply definitive\" of a shopping cart, that can be used to indicate that the requisition per supplier cannot be merged with other requisitions (as part of the process step Place order). Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Estimated allowed? If an estimate is allowed, the checkbox \"Estimated\" will be available with the requisition for the item to be able to submit a requisition with estimated costs. It also makes it possible to include estimated costs for items in the catalog. #### Show estimated amount on order form? This indicates on the order form to the supplier that the costs are quoted as estimated. Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Direct order If direct orders are allowed, you can indicate under organization unit, item type and employee that direct orders are allowed. A direct order is ordered immediately after the requisition. Any approval must be given separately from this prior to invoice processing. #### Group order based on receiving location Orders are created and placed per supplier, organizational unit and requester/employee. Use this indicator if you want to merge requisitions per supplier and delivery address in order to hold on to the order until a desired volume has been reached before the order is placed. Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Item overview filter required? The item overview in the internal catalog in the request process step is then not loaded. A search with search criteria must then first be entered in order to display the list of items. #### Reserve order numbers possible If it is allowed to reserve order numbers, then the button \"Reserve order number\" can be used in the process step Supplement and Approve. Column 1 Column 2 --- --- Financial #### Item type per adm. for item? In that case, there is no need to specify a \"Per administration\" device per item. This is then taken over from the item type unless it has been set up for the item. #### Item type sync for all administrations If the same cost categories (general ledger accounts) are used in all administrations and these correspond one-to-one for the entire organization in relation to the item type. All changes regarding item types are then automatically implemented for all administrations. In other words, the changes in the data module \"Per administration\" for the active administration are automatically implemented or created for all other administrations in the data module \"Per administration (management)\". Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Org. unit authorization for all administrations If the authorization applies to all administrations, the authorization of an employee in the link to an organizational unit will be implemented in the same way for all administrations. #### Write off booking allowed Using the other \"ToDo action incoming invoice\" it will be allowed to write off an amount instead of a number of items (e.g., installments) for an invoice booking, assuming the quantity of the order line is one. The checkbox \"Number fixed\" will then be set by default. Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Skip approval by fin. Admin. Using the other \"ToDo action incoming invoice\" the check on cost type for the invoice booking and the order line will be skipped, and the checkbox \"Financial administration\" will be set by default when an invoice is approved. #### Item cost type investment per administration An employee can then choose to book on the cost type investment with the free request or when changing items in the shopping cart. For Items and Item types, this investment cost type can be specified in the data modules \"Per administration\" and \"Per administration (Management)\". Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### More receiving allowed? Is it allowed to register more items upon receipt than the total requested? #### Overpay allowed? Is it then allowed when booking the invoice (even if it is reported by an external system (such as ScanSys ImageCapture)) that the booked amount is higher than what was registered on receipt? Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Remove invoices active This indicates that it is allowed to delete invoices in Shopper (even if they have been added from ImageCapture). #### Booking items editable during approval If it is allowed for booking items to be edited during the process step Approve, then the requisition-/order line will include the button in the column \"Change booking items\". Column 1 Column 2 --- --- #### Contract offtakes not approved show ImageCapture Contract offtake that has not yet been approved will not be visible in ImageCapture, however if this indicator is set the unapproved offtake will also become visible in ImageCapture, allowing invoices to be matched before the offtake is approved. <p>Note: The indicator \"Group order based on receiving location\" is only available if you purchased the license module \"SHOPMOD-CO Shopper module Contract offtake, contract invoices, contract utilization and order advice optimalization\" or if you use the Shopper Enterprise Edition.</p>"},{"location":"#supplement-completeness-check-data-module","title":"\"Supplement Completeness Check\" data module","text":"<p>Using this data module, you can define what completeness checks can be used for the setup of the workflow step Supplement.
